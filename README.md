# Mandarin tones practice app
Practice mandarin tones in context. Inspired by the tone trainer in <a href="https://www.dong-chinese.com/learn/sounds/pinyin/toneTrainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline">Dong Chinese</a> and others, where I was missing some examples with full sentences. Try it: [Web](https://nestor98.github.io/mandarin_tones/) or [android](https://github.com/nestor98/mandarin_tones/releases)
